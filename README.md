About Predicting how capable each applicant is of repaying a loan

# Problem Define 
Home Credit, a technology-based financing company, faces challenges in predicting loan repayment ability. They want to improve their current method, which relies on statistical techniques and machine learning. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can determine whether a lender will be able to repay their loan using alternative data sources, such as telecommunications and transaction information. This will allow them to approve loans for capable borrowers and offer appropriate repayment plans, ultimately driving financial success for Home Credit and its clients.
